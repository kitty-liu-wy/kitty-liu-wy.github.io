<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi! I am a PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Cambridge. I work on historical linguistics, and my PhD project looks at the diachrony of clause chaining in Tibetic languages. I began my PhD in October 2025, and my research is funded by the <a href="https://www.cambridgetrust.org" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cambridge Trust</a>.</p> <p>My working languages are English and Mandarin Chinese. I can also try to talk to you in Swedish.</p> <p>Since I have a very common surname, I publish under both my English and Chinese given names. In English-speaking contexts, I go by Kitty Liu /ˈkɪ.ti lʲʉ/. In Mandarin-speaking contexts, I go by 刘文樱 liú wényīng [li̯ɤ͡ʊ̯˧˥ vən˧˥ jɪŋ˥].</p> </body></html>
