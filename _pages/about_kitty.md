My name is Kitty Liu /ˈkɪ.ti lʲʉ/ or 刘文樱 liú wényīng [li̯ɤ͡ʊ̯˧˥ vən˧˥ jɪŋ˥]. My pronouns are she/any. I go by Kitty in English-speaking contexts, but I publish under Kitty Wenying Liu since I have a very common surname. I grew up in Beijing (China) and Cambridge (UK). My working languages are English and Mandarin Chinese. I can also try to talk to you in Swedish.

Outside of linguistics, I enjoy literature, crafts, and hot drinks. I am also a semi-professional choral singer.
