My name is Kitty Liu or 刘文樱 liú wényīng. My pronouns are she/any. I grew up in Beijing (China) and Cambridge (UK). Outside of linguistics, I enjoy literature, crafts, spirited conversation, and hot drinks. I am also a semi-professional choral singer. 

My working langauges are English and Mandarin Chinese. I can also try to talk to you in Swedish.

Because I have a very common surname, I use both of my given names when I publish. Since I didn't learn IPA to never use it, here is how I pronounce my names in my accents: Kitty Liu [ˈkʰɪ.tiˑ lʲʉ] ; 刘文樱 liú wényīng [li̯ɤ͡ʊ̯˧˥ vən˧˥ jɪŋ˥]
