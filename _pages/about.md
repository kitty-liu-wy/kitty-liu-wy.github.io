Hi! I am a PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Cambridge. I work on historical linguistics, and my PhD project looks at the diachrony of clause chaining in Tibetic languages. I began my PhD in October 2025, and my research is funded by the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org). 

You can contact me at wl399 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk .

# Research interests

I am interested in how language changes over time, and in the interactivity between changes across different linguistic domains. I have been pursuing these themes by focusing on the diachrony of Tibetic langauges. I am currently focusing on the diachrony of clause chaining - at the interface of discourse, syntax, and morphology - in my PhD research, but I have also worked on the historical phonology and morphophonology of Tibetic languages.
