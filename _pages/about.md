Hi! I am a PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Cambridge. I work on historical linguistics, and my PhD project looks at the diachrony of clause chaining in Tibetic languages. I began my PhD in October 2025, and my research is funded by the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org). 

My working languages are English and Mandarin Chinese. I can also try to talk to you in Swedish.

Since I have a very common surname, I publish under both my English and Chinese given names. In English-speaking contexts, I go by Kitty Liu /ˈkɪ.ti lʲʉ/. In Mandarin-speaking contexts, I go by 刘文樱 liú wényīng [li̯ɤ͡ʊ̯˧˥ vən˧˥ jɪŋ˥].
